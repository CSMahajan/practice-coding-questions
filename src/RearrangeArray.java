/*
* Rearrange an array with O(1) extra space
*
* Given an array arr[] of size N where every element is in the range from 0 to n-1.
* Rearrange the given array so that the transformed array arrT[i] becomes arr[arr[i]].

NOTE: arr and arrT are both same variables,
* representing the array before and after transformation respectively.
*
* Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {4,0,2,1,3}
Output: 3 4 2 0 1
Explanation:
arr[arr[0]] = arr[4] = 3.
arr[arr[1]] = arr[0] = 4.
and so on.

    * Letâ€™s assume an element is a and another element is b,

    * So the element becomes a + b*n so when a + b*n is divided by n then the value is b and a + b*n % n is a.
    * The array elements of the given array lie from 0 to n-1.
    * Now an array element is needed that can store two different values at the same time.
    * To achieve this, every element at ith index is incremented by (arr[arr[i]] % n)*n.
    * After the increment operation of the first step, every element holds both old values and new values.
    * An old value can be obtained by arr[i]%n and a new value can be obtained by arr[i]/n.
